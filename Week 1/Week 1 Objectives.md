#### Algorithm and Complexity
- Understand the concept of an [[Algorithm]]
- Understand algorithmic complexity
	- See how [[Time Complexity|complexity]] is defined
	- Understand the basics of [[Asymptotic Upper Bounds|asymptotic]]
	- Study [[Big-O |The Big-O notation]] and its basic properties
- Understand [[Function Growth Rates|common complexity "classes"]]

#### Sorting (why would they shift this here..?)
- [[Bubble Sort]]
- [[Selection Sort]]
- [[Insertion Sort]]
- Properties of algorithms
	- [[Invariants]]
- Complexity of these Sorting algorithms
