#### [[Time Complexity]]
- How much time does an algorithm spend solving a problem
	- Measured as the number of elementary operation performed
#### Space Complexity
- How many space does an algorithm spend solving a problem
	- Measured as the amount of "memory" occupied simultaneously

Both are measured with input size
