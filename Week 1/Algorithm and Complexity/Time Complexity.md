- Can be measured as a function of input size
	- Given an input size `n`, we can calculate the value `T(n)` as the number of 'elementary' steps performed by the algorithm on the input of size n

#### Worst Case Complexity
- how does the algorithm perform when n is large
- The "order of approximation" of T(n) when n approaches+âˆž
	- Big-O Notation
	- Order of approximation - making a difficult problem easier by considering only the most important information

#### Input size
- the type of the input
- for example
	- numeric input
		- length of binary representation
		- its value
	- collection
		- number of elements in the collection
	- string input
		- number of characters
